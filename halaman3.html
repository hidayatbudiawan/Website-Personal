    <p>Hi, let me introduce myself, I am Hidayat, a fresh graduate from Mathematics UGM who graduated on August 29, 2024. Currently, I am looking for a job. In between looking for a job, I attended bootcamps here and there to improve my skills. One of the ones I attended was this bootcamp from dibimbing.id. Here, I learned to create a website. Yes, this is what my first website looks like, I really hope this website will grow.</p>
